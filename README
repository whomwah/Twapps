A couple of simple Twitter clients
----------------------------------

These are a couple of command line programs I wrote on the
train the other day on the way home. Very simple in concept, 
they may break, I just wanted to tweet from the terminal
and also wanted to be able to send images to TwitPic.

tw <message> 
Lets you post a message to Twitter. It returns the message sent

tp <path/to/image> 
Lets you post an image to TwitPic. It returns the url of the image

Examples:

tw Hello World
tw "Hello with ' in it" 

tp ~/path/to/image.jpg
tp path/to/image.jpg

tp ~/path/to/image.jpg | tw Check out this image


Required gems:

httpclient
twitter
